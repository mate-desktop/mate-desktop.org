# The migration

For the benefit of the MATE developers and admins, here is a rundown of how the
WordPress site was migrated to Nikola way back in the past.

## Python 2.7

Nikola is being powered by Python 2.7 and some additional packages were required
on the server.

    sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev libfreetype6-dev libjpeg8-dev libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev libyaml-dev

### What are these requirements for?

  * `python2.7-dev` provides the header files for Python 2.7 so that Python modules 
  with C extensions can be built.

The following are required to build `pillow`, the Python imaging library.

  * `libjpeg8-dev`
  * `libfreetype6-dev`

The following are required to build `lxml`, a Python XML library.

  * `libxml2-dev`
  * `libxslt1-dev`

The following are required to build `python-coveralls`.

  * `libyaml-dev`

### virtualenv

[`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is used to create
sandboxed Python environments, so you don't pollute the system Python. This is
how the `virtualenv` for Nikola was created.

    cd ~
    curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.10.1.tar.gz
    tar xvfz virtualenv-1.10.1.tar.gz
    cd virtualenv-1.10.1
    sudo python setup.py install

### Install Nikola 6.4.0

Create an environment for Nikola.

    mkdir ~/PythonEnvs
    virtualenv -p python2.7 ~/PythonEnvs/nikola-64

Activate the environment.

    source ~/PythonEnvs/nikola-64/bin/activate

Download Nikola 6.4.0

    mkdir -p ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/src
    cd ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/src
    wget https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/archive/v6.4.0.tar.gz -O nikola-640.tar.gz
    tar zxvf nikola-640.tar.gz
    cd nikola-6.4.0

Install the Nikola requirements.

    pip install cython
    pip install -r requirements-full.txt

Actually install nikola.

    python setup.py install

## Migrate WordPress to Nikola

Export the WordPress content.

  * `Tools -> Export -> All Content`

Make sure the Nikola environment is activated.

    source ~/PythonEnvs/nikola-64/bin/activate

Clone the mate-desktop.org Git repository.

    cd ~/Websites
    git clone https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-desktop.org

Run the migration.

    nikola import_wordpress ~/Downloads/mate.wordpress.2013-10-23.xml ~/Migration

The only interesting log entries form the migration were:

    [2013-10-23T15:26:02Z] WARNING: import_wordpress: Not going to import "Wiki" because it seems to contain no content.
    [2013-10-23T15:26:02Z] WARNING: import_wordpress: Not going to import "Forum" because it seems to contain no content.

`rsync` the migrated files to the git repository.

    rsync -av ~/Migration/ ~/Websites/mate-desktop.org/

Install [html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text).

    pip install https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text/archive/master.zip

Convert the WordPress `.wp` faux HTML files to
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and correct the image
links.

    cd ~/Websites/mate-desktop.org/posts
    for FILE in *.wp; do html2text ${FILE} > `basename ${FILE} .wp`.md; done
    for FILE in *.md; do sed -i 's/\/martin\/Migration//g' ${FILE}; done
    rm *.wp
    cd ~/Websites/mate-desktop.org/stories
    for FILE in *.wp; do html2text ${FILE} > `basename ${FILE} .wp`.md; done
    for FILE in *.md; do sed -i 's/\/martin\/Migration//g' ${FILE}; done
    rm *.wp

The metadata and content were merged using `scripts/merge_meta.sh`.

# The clean up

At this point you have a basic Nikola site that preserves all the content (but
not the comments) from the WordPress site. Now the hacking begins.

# Building and deploying the site

When the site cleanup is complete, Nikola will be integrated with Git so that
any new pushes to the mate-desktop.org Git repository will automatically
trigger a Nikola build and deploy.

In the meantime, here is how Nikola can be run manually. This assumes you are
running as me on the server, however.

    source ~/PythonEnvs/nikola-64/bin/activate
    cd ~/Websites/mate-desktop.org
    nikola build
    nikola deploy

# TODO

  * Add more text to the homepage.
    * Floating MATE logo
    * All the applications, with improved layout.
  * Integrate SocialSharePrivacy
