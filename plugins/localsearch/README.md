If you don't want to depend on Google or DuckDuckGo to implement search for you,
or just want it to work even if you are offline, enable this plugin and the
search will be performed client side. It uses [Tipue](https://www.tipue.com/search/) as its engine.

After you build your site, you will have several new files in assets/css and assets/js
and a tipue_search.html that you can use as a basis for using this in your site.

For more information about how to customize it and use it, please refer to the tipue
docs at https://www.tipue.com/search/
