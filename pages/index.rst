.. slug: index
.. pretty_url: False

The MATE Desktop Environment is the continuation of GNOME 2. It provides an intuitive and attractive desktop 
environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

MATE is under active development to add support for new technologies while preserving a traditional desktop 
experience. See the `Roadmap <http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/roadmap>`_ The `MATE Manifesto 
<http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/board:manifesto>`_ outlines some of the principles that guide the project.

Applications
------------

MATE is composed of a number of applications. The renaming is necessary to
avoid conflicts with GNOME components.

Caja
====

Pluma is a text editor which supports most standard editor features. It also
extends this basic functionality with other features not usually found in
simple text editors. Pluma is a graphical application which supports editing
multiple text files in one window (known sometimes as tabs or MDI). Pluma fully
supports international text through its use of the Unicode UTF-8 encoding in
edited files. Its core feature set includes syntax highlighting of source code,
auto indentation, and printing support (with print preview). Pluma is a fork of
Gedit. 

Eye of MATE
===========

uses the gdk-pixbuf library. It can deal with large images, and can zoom and
scroll with constant memory usage. Its goals are simplicity and standards
compliance. Eye of MATE is a fork of Eye of GNOME.

Atril
=====

PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), DJVU, DVI, XPS and Portable

searching for text, copying text to the clipboard, hypertext navigation, and
table-of-contents bookmarks. Atril is a fork of Evince.

contained in an archive, and extract files from archive. Engrampa is a fork of

MATE Terminal
=============

.. image:: /assets/img/mate/terminal.png

MATE Terminal is a terminal emulation application that you can use to access a
UNIX shell in the MATE environment. With it, you can run any application that
is designed to run on VT102, VT220, and xterm terminals. MATE Terminal also has
the ability to use multiple terminals in a single window (tabs) and supports
management of different configurations (profiles). MATE Terminal is a fork of
GNOME Terminal.

------------------------------
Where does the name come from?
------------------------------

The name *"MATE"*, pronounced *Ma-Tay*, comes from `yerba mat√©
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate>`_, a species of holly native to
subtropical South America. Its leaves contain caffeine and are used to make
infusions and a beverage called mate.
