The MATE Desktop Environment is the continuation of GNOME 2. It provides
an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional
metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

MATE is under active development to add support for new technologies
while preserving a traditional desktop experience. See the
[Roadmap](https://wiki.mate-desktop.org/developers-corner/roadmap/).

Applications
============

MATE is composed of a number of applications. The renaming is necessary
to avoid conflicts with GNOME components.

Caja
----

browsing directories, as well as previewing files and launching
applications associated with them. It is also responsible for handling

Pluma is a text editor which supports most standard editor features. It
also extends this basic functionality with other features not usually
found in simple text editors. Pluma is a graphical application which
supports editing multiple text files in one window (known sometimes as
tabs or MDI). Pluma fully supports international text through its use of
the Unicode UTF-8 encoding in edited files. Its core feature set
includes syntax highlighting of source code, auto indentation, and
printing support (with print preview). Pluma is a fork of Gedit.

Eye of MATE
-----------

eom or the Eye of MATE is a simple graphics viewer for the MATE desktop
which uses the gdk-pixbuf library. It can deal with large images, and
can zoom and scroll with constant memory usage. Its goals are simplicity
and standards compliance. Eye of MATE is a fork of Eye of GNOME.

Atril
-----

PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), DJVU, DVI, XPS and
Portable Document Format (PDF) files. When supported by the document, it
also allows searching for text, copying text to the clipboard, hypertext
navigation, and table-of-contents bookmarks. Atril is a fork of Evince.

Engrampa

to create and modify archives, view the contents of an archive, view a
file contained in an archive, and extract files from archive. Engrampa
is a fork of File Roller.

MATE Terminal
-------------

MATE Terminal is a terminal emulation application that you can use to
access a UNIX shell in the MATE environment. With it, you can run any
application that is designed to run on VT102, VT220, and xterm
terminals. MATE Terminal also has the ability to use multiple terminals
in a single window (tabs) and supports management of different
configurations (profiles). MATE Terminal is a fork of GNOME Terminal.

Where does the name come from?
==============================

The name *\"MATE\"*, pronounced *Ma-Tay*, comes from [yerba
mat√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate), a species of holly
native to subtropical South America. Its leaves contain caffeine and are
used to make infusions and a beverage called mate.
