The MATE Team is very happy to say hello to the new Debian MATE Packaging
Team, that is [working hard](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=708385#31)
to get MATE included into the next release of Debian.

First packages are already in the repositories and there are many others
in [ftp-master NEW queue](https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html).

A big thanks to:

  * [John Paul Adrian Glaubitz](http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~glaubitz/)
  * [Mike Gabriel](https://sunweavers.net/blog/)
  * [Vangelis Mouhtsis]
  * [Kees Cook](https://outflux.net/)


If you want to join the team, please reach the members on IRC in the
[#debian-mate](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#debian-mate) channel @
