We have given the MATE website a make-over and also migrated from
[Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) to [Nikola](http://getnikola.com)
in the process.

The main objective of the re-design is to create simple, elegant site
that helps you find the information you're looking for quickly. Access
to most MATE resources should be no more than two clicks from the
homepage.

A secondary objective was to migrate to a content management system with
a work-flow the developers and contributors are more familiar with
and that also facilitates contributions from the wider community. This
is the principile reason we migrated to Nikola, which is a static site 
generator.

Anyone can submit a new blog post, corrections or translations to the MATE
website by creating a free account on [GitHub](Markdown), forking the 
[mate-desktop.org repository](http://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-desktop.org)
and [creating a pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
Pull-requests for mate-desktop.org will be reviewed by our Webmasters,
merged and published here. The are some
[other benefits of using a static site generator](http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#why-static).

Unfortunately, we have decided not to migrate comments from the old
website. From this point forward each new blog post will be linked to 
a topic in the [MATE forums](http://forums.mate-desktop.org/). We are
doing this because we already have a
[dedicated team of forum moderators](http://forums.mate-desktop.org/memberlist.php?mode=leaders)
and don't want to draw on their limited time by asking them to moderate
blog comments on a 3rd party comment provider. Besides, this approach will
drive more readers to the MATE forums and will hope fully help grow and
develop the community. We hope you understand our decision.
