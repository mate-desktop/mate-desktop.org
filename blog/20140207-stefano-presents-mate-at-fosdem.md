On February 1st 2014 [Stefano Karapetsas](https://github.com/stefano-k)
presented his talk on MATE at [FOSDEM 2014](https://fosdem.org)!

The talk introduces MATE to those who haven't heard of it and explains the
projects origins. The differences between MATE and other traditional GTK based
desktops is covered and then Stefano goes on to explain how MATE has evolved
since it was forked from GNOME2. A brief run down of the recent improvements 
is covered followed by an overview of the MATE roadmap and other
