On the way to getting MATE officially available on [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org),
the community repositories have to be changed in YaST. For that,
go to _YaST -> Software -> Software Repositories_ and remove the _X11:MATE:Factory_
repo and next, click on the following links in function of your openSUSE
version:

  * <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/MATE:/STABLE:/1.6/> for OpenSUSE 12.2
  * <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/MATE:/STABLE:/1.6/> for OpenSUSE 12.3
  * <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/MATE:/STABLE:/1.6/> for OpenSUSE Tumbleweed

Thank you!
