Thanks to the efforts of the [MATE package maintainers for Debian](https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-mate)
MATE 1.8.1 is available in Debian Jessie (testing) and also
[Debian backports](http://backports.debian.org) for Wheezy.

As a result of MATE 1.8.1 hitting the Debian testing repositories
earlier this year, MATE 1.8.1 is also in the official archive
for Ubuntu 14.10 Utopic Unicorn. The [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org)
team have recently created a [MATE 1.8.1 PPA for Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mate-dev/+archive/ubuntu/trusty-mate)
at the request of the [Ubuntu Technical Board](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2014-July/001981.html)
and also a [MATE 1.8.1 PPA for Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mate-dev/+archive/ubuntu/precise-mate)

If you require MATE packages for Debian or Ubuntu then the package 
repositories above are the official repositories to use.

We've removed the package repositories hosted on mate-desktop.org 
because some were unsigned and others have not been maintained for many 
months. Therefore, as of now, the Debian and Ubuntu package 
repositories hosted on mate-desktop.org have been removed.
