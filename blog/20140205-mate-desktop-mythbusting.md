I was fortunate enough to be invited on to Episode 26 of the [Linux 
Unplugged](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linuxun/) podcast to talk a 
little about MATE Desktop and where it is headed. The MATE Mythbusting clip is
embedded below.

I wasn't able to cover all the development objectives of MATE 1.8 in the time 
available so I recommend you take a look at the [MATE Roadmap](https://wiki.mate-desktop.org/#!pages/roadmap.md)
for a complete overview. If you should have any additional questions, or would
like to contribute to the the project, then we look for to chatting with you 
in the [#mate IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mate) or 
reviewing your [pull-requests on GitHub](https://github.com/mate-desktop). 

[Jupiter Broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com) produce a number of 
weekly videocasts and podcasts mostly oriented around FLOSS. Take a look, you 
may find something that interests you.
