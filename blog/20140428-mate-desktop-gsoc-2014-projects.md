After several weeks of review the application and selection period for the 
2014 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is over. 4,420 students proposed a total of
6,313  projects for this summer. From those, 1,307 students have been accepted
and the MATE Desktop project is one of the 190 Open Source projects that will
be  working with students this year.

In our second year as a GSoC mentor organisation the MATE team received 4
student proposals we were allocated 3 slots for student projects.

I'm delighted to introduce our GSoC students for 2014:

  * Avishkar Gupta will be working on adding ePub rendering capabilities to
  Atril, the document viewer of the MATE desktop.
  * Michal Ratajsky will be working on adding GStreamer 1.0 support into the 
  MATE desktop environment in order to replace the dependency on the deprecated 
  GStreamer 0.10 library.
  * Alexander van der Meij will be working on improving Caja extensions so they 
  can be integrated during runtime and also create a single user interface for
  Caja extension configuration.

Please join me in welcoming these new contributors to the MATE team and wish
them every success with their respective projects for the summer.

On behalf on the entire MATE team I'd also like to extend our thanks and
gratitude to [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org) who are our GSoC organiser for
2014. They did a fantastic job in helping secure these GSoC placements for the
MATE team that will provide much need development resources to the project.
