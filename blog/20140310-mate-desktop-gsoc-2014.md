## About Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/) (commonly called as 
GSoC) is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write 
code for various open source software projects. GSoC works with many open 
source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund 
projects over a three month period. Since its inception in 2005, the program 
has brought together over 7,500 successful student participants from 97 
countries and over 7,000 mentors from over 100 countries worldwide to produce 
over 50 million lines of code. Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student 
applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating 
projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios 
and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic 
pursuits. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify 
and bring in new developers. Best of all, more source code is created and 
released for the use and benefit of all.

## For students

In short the MATE GSoC project ideas for 2014 are:

  * ePub format support in Atril
  * GStreamer-1.0 support
  * Plugin system in Caja

As always, the key is to start early and to interact with mentors and the 
community at large. Fixing bugs, submitting pull requests and working on Proof 
of Concepts is a good way to get started.

The GSoC 2014 mentors for MATE are Stefano Karapetsas (`stefano-k` on IRC) and 
Martin Wimpress (`flexiondotorg` on IRC). The best way to communicate and 
interact with the MATE mentors is via:

  * [#mate IRC channel on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mate)
  * [mate-dev mailing list](http://ml.mate-desktop.org/listinfo/)
  * [MATE on GitHub](https://github.com/mate-desktop)

We look forward to reviewing your applications!
