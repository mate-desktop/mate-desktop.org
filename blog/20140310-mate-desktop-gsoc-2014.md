The MATE team are very pleased to announce that we are participatiing in

in partnership with our good friends at [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org)

## About Google Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code (commonly called as GSoC) is a global program that 
offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source 
software projects. GSoC works with many open source, free software, and 
technology-related groups to identify and fund projects over a three month 
period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together over 
7,500 successful student participants from 97 countries and over 7,000 
mentors from over 100 countries worldwide to produce over 50 million lines 
of code. Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are 
paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus 
gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the 
opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits. In 
turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring 
in new developers. Best of all, more source code is created and released for 
the use and benefit of all.

## For students

**The student application period is open from March 10th 2014 until March 21st 2014.**

In short the MATE GSoC project ideas for 2014 are:

  * ePub format support in Atril
  * GStreamer-1.0 support
  * Plugin system in Caja

As always, the key is to start early and to interact with mentors and the 
community at large. Fixing bugs, submitting pull requests and working on Proof 
of Concepts is a good way to get started.

The GSoC 2014 mentors for MATE are Stefano Karapetsas (`stefano-k` on IRC) and 
Martin Wimpress (`flexiondotorg` on IRC). The best way to communicate and 
interact with the MATE mentors is via:

  * [#mate IRC channel on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mate)
  * [MATE on GitHub](https://github.com/mate-desktop)

We look forward to reviewing your applications!
