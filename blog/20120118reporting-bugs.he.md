We are currently in the process of switching to handling all our issues via
the [mate-desktop project on GitHub](https://github.com/mate-desktop) instead
of Perberos' page. The reason is simple: when Perberos is away none of the
other developers can close tickets. This creates a bit of a mess.

Now, when you go to report a bug you must chose the correct GitHub repository
to report the issue in. It's pretty simple. If there's a bug with `mate-panel`,
then submit the issue on the `mate-panel` issue tracker.

We'll are no longer monitoring Perberos' issue tracker, so we ask that you
refrain from opening new bugs there.

Thanks for your cooperation.
