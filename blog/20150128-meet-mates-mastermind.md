I was fortunate enough to be invited on to Episode 347 of the [Linux 
Action Show](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linuxactionshow/) to
talk a little about MATE Desktop, where it came from and where it is headed.
The interview with me is embedded below.

I wasn't able to cover all the development objectives of MATE 1.10 in the time 
available so I recommend you take a look at the [MATE Roadmap](https://wiki.mate-desktop.org/roadmap)
for a complete overview. If you should have any additional questions, or would
like to contribute to the project, then we look forward to chatting with
you in the [#mate IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mate) or 
reviewing your [pull-requests on GitHub](https://github.com/mate-desktop). 

[Jupiter Broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com) produce a number of 
weekly videocasts and podcasts mostly oriented around FLOSS. Take a look, you 
may find something that interests you.
