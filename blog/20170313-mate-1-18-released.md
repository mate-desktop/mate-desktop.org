## What's new in MATE 1.18

The release is focused on completing the migration to GTK3+ and
adopting new technologies to replace some of deprecated components MATE
Desktop 1.16 still relied on.

The headline changes in MATE Desktop 1.18 are:

  * **The entire MATE Desktop suite of applications and components is now GTK3+ only!**
    * Requires GTK+ >= 3.14.
    * All GTK2+ code has been dropped including the `--with-gtk` build option.
  * Completed the migration to `GtkApplication` from `libunique`.
  * **Added `libinput` support for mouse and touchpad.**
    * Separate settings for handedness (left/right-handed) and motion acceleration/threshold.
  * **Much improved accessibility support (particularly for visually impaired users).**
     * Many thanks to our friends at [Hypra.fr](https://hypra.fr/-Home-17-.html?lang=en) for their contribution!
  * **Caja adds several new features** including:
      * Added a copy queue and copy pausing.
      * Asking confirmation before moving files to the Trash.
      * Support for back/forward mouse buttons for directory navigation.
      * Notification when ejected drives are safe to unplug.
  * **Lock screen will load the users selected background** instead of the system defined default.
  * MATE Panel gets several improvements, including:
    * **Added [desktop actions](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/) support for additional launch options**.
    * Added StatusNotifier support.
    * **Added support for [Menulibre](https://smdavis.us/projects/menulibre/) menu editor**, if installed it is preferred over Mozo.
  * Engrampa, the archive manager, includes a number of improvements:
    * Added `ear` and `war` to the supported types list.
    * Check the rar/unrar version to the correct date is shown.
    * Fixed compress rar and 7z split into volumes.
  * **Notifications now implement action icons support**, for example playback control icons used by media players.
  * Reworked the font viewer to add font browsing mode, support for TTC fonts and expose it in the menus by default.
  * **Replaced deprecated `upower` suspend/hibernate functions with ConsoleKit2 equivalents**.
  * MATE Terminal adds the ability to close tabs with middle mouse button. 
  * **Atril, the document viewer, has much improved page load times** and adds support for `unarchiver` used by some comics.
  * Lots of deprecated GTK+ methods have been replaced and many bugs have been fixed.
  * **The plugin systems, and all C and Python plugins, in Eye of MATE and Pluma have been ported to `libpeas`.**
  * Translations are updated. *Thank you to our team of translators!*
  * A number of **memory leaks have been plugged**.
  * *A-n-d most exciting of all...* **MATE Calculator is back and has been ported to GTK3+** `:-D`
