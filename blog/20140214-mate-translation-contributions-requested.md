Show your love for the MATE project this Valentines Day, shower us with
translations!

Translators are the unsung heroes of the MATE development team and once again we
call upon them to help improve the project. MATE 1.7 is well into final testing
and QA and soon MATE 1.8 will be prepared for release.

Therefore we request that you check the status of the MATE translations you
contribute to at Transifex and update them ASAP.

If you are not yet a member of the translation team but would like to help then please
[sign up for a free account at Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/signup/contributor/)
so you can start contributing to MATE, we'd really appreciate it!

There are currently 6 languages with 100% coverage, so lets see how many more
can get 100% coverage before the MATE 1.8 release.
