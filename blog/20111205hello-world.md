Hello World! Gnome 2 was the most popular Linux desktop but it's no longer
available... MATE is here to provide that same desktop to you :) Perberos
initially forked Gnome 2 and called the project MATE. Users and developers
were successful at running MATE in Arch Linux and due to popular demand
Perberos made it easier for MATE to compile under Debian. Stefano-k and myself
then joined the project and packaged it for Debian and Linux Mint. The MATE
desktop was featured in Linux Mint 12 and is now quickly gaining momentum. Our
top priority is to improve MATE and for it to be on par, in terms of features
and stability, with Gnome 2.32. We'll port themes, applets, and applications
which were developed for Gnome 2, and help developers port theirs to this new
desktop.
