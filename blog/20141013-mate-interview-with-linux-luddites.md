[Linux Luddites](https://linuxluddites.com) were kind enough to interview
me last week. We discussed the origins of [MATE Desktop](https://mate-desktop.org),
it's future direction, how [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org) came to
be and where it is headed.

[Linux Luddites Episode #26](https://linuxluddites.com/shows/episode-26)
was published earlier today and I suggest you head over to the Linux Luddites
website and give it a listen.

If you've not listened to the Linux Luddites before then you should checkout
their back catalog. It has been one of my favourite FLOSS podcasts for some
months now that blends good discussion and insight with useful distro reviews
and first impressions.
