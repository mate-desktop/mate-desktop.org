The MATE team encourages you to head over to [Linux Voice on indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/linux-voice)
and find out why you, as an Open Source user and enthusiast, should back [Linux Voice](https://www.linuxvoice.com/).
Here are some of the reasons we are endorsing this project:

  * Formed by the majority of the editorial team behind Linux Format magazine.
  * 50% of Linux Voice profits will go back to Free Software and Linux communities.
  * Linux Voice content will be published for free after 9 months under [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license.
  * One of the Linux Voice team is interested in covering MATE if their project is successfully funded.
