We're proud to announce our newest package on GitHub:

  * [MATE University](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-university)

MATE University is targeted at all levels of developers (including beginners)
to learn how to develop new panel applets, Caja (file manager) extensions,
Pluma (text editor) and Eye of MATE (image viewer) plugins, etc. to expand
the already powerful MATE Desktop experience. There will be simple and well
commented code, makefiles and tips to use as springboard for new MATE applications.
