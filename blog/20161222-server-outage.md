The server that runs this website went offline without notice yesterday.
We don't know why and we've had no contact from our server host. **We do
have complete backups, no data has been lost.** We've started to restore
services and the outstanding service will be reinstated as time permits
over the holiday period.

We will update this page as services come back online.

## What is the impact?

  * `git.mate-desktop.org` - This is a mirror of the [MATE Desktop GitHub](https://github.com/mate-desktop).
  * `mail.mate-desktop.org` - Mail server for developers.
  * `planet.mate-desktop.org` - The MATE Desktop planet.
  * `ml.mate-desktop.org` - The mailing lists, which are rarely used.
  * `forums.mate-desktop.org` - The forums, which we started shutting down earlier in the year and are locked.
