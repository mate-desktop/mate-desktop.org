The server that runs this website went offline without notice yesterday.
We don't know why and we've had no contact from our server host. **We do
have complete backups, no data has been lost.** We've started to restore
services and the outstanding service will be reinstated as time permits
over the holiday period.

We will update this page as services come back online.

## What is the impact?

This services are currently down, listed in order of restore priority

  * `ml.mate-desktop.org` - The mailing lists, which are rarely used.
  * `forums.mate-desktop.org` - The forums, which we started shutting down earlier in the year and are locked.

## What has been restored?

  * <https://www.mate-desktop.org> - This website
  * <https://pub.mate-desktop.org> - Where you can find the tarballs of MATE Desktop releases.
  * <https://wiki.mate-desktop.org/#!index.md> - The developer wiki.
