**It is with regret that we are informing you all that the MATE Desktop forums are closing with immediate 
effect.**

For sometime now the forum moderators have struggled to keep up with the pace of discussion, combatting spam
and new registrations. The original forum administrators are no longer actively participating in the MATE 
Desktop forums either. It is therefore unfortunate that we have decided to close the MATE Desktop forums
and we encourage anyone seeking MATE support to head to one of the following distribution specific forums:

  * [Arch Linux Forum](https://bbs.archlinux.org/)
  * [Debian User Forums](http://forums.debian.net/)
  * [Fedora Forum](https://fedoraforum.org/)
  * [Gentoo Discussion Forums](https://forums.gentoo.org/)
  * [Linux Mint Forums](https://forums.linuxmint.com/)
  * [Salix Forums](https://www.salixos.org/)
  * [Ubuntu MATE Forums](https://ubuntu-mate.community)
  * [MATE Desktop subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MATEDesktop)

MATE Desktop also has official threads in various distribution forums:

  * [MATE thread on Arch Linux topic](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=121162&p=1)
  * [MATE thread on SalixOS topic](https://www.salixos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=3371)
  * [MATE thread on Ubuntu topic](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11333073)

MATE Desktop discussion can also be found on Google+ and Twitter.

  * [MATE Desktop Twitter](https://twitter.com/mate_desktop)

We'd like to thank the MATE Desktop forum moderators, past and present, for all the time and effort they've 
invested into the forums over the years and hope to see them find moderator roles in some of the discussion 
forums we've highlighted above.

Should anyone want to take on the administration and moderation of the MATE Desktop forums then please come 
and chat with the [MATE Desktop team](/team/) in the `#mate-dev` IRC channel on Freenode. We can potentially 
reactivate the forums.
