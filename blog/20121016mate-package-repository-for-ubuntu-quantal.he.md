An [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) package repository for Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal
is now available for our 1.4 release. As usual, follow [these instructions](https://wiki.mate-desktop.org/#!pages/download.md).

If you're upgrading from an older release please make sure that you remove the old
repositories and add the new ones, otherwise you will encounter problems.
